# üåü Node.js Learning Journey: From Beginner to Advanced

This repository covers my complete learning path of **Node.js** from scratch to advanced level, including **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **API development**, and **deployment**. It also includes practical topics like version control, hosting, and working with tools like Postman, Compass, and Render.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è CRUD Operations (REST API)

- GET method ‚Äì list all persons
- POST method ‚Äì save data to DB
- PUT method ‚Äì update data
- DELETE method ‚Äì remove data
- REST API checks using Postman

---

## üåç MongoDB (Local + Atlas)

- Importance of Database
- Difference between DB server & NodeJS server
- Installing MongoDB locally
- SQL vs MongoDB syntax
- Run queries in Mongo Shell

- Important Git commands
- Add code, commit and deploy to GitHub
- Use of `.gitignore` file
- Use of `.env` file and `dotenv` package

---

## üåê Hosting

- Host MongoDB using **MongoDB Atlas**
- Host NodeJS server using **Render**
- Manage APIs using **Postman Folder**

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure Reference

This project follows a well-organized folder structure for separating:
- Routes
- Controllers
- Models
- Config
- Utils

---

## ‚úÖ Tools Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Git & GitHub
- Render
- Postman
- MongoDB Compass

---

## üìå Note

This repo is built step-by-step and may be useful for anyone learning Node.js, MongoDB, and backend development using the MERN stack.
